  "summary": "Local law enforcement has opened an investigation into the theft of medical records from Northern Inyo Hospital in a case that has shaken community members and NIH itself. This past summer, hospital officials noticed that an employee in the records department had illegally obtained and was in possession of a patients medical file. Hospital Administrator John Halfen said Thursday that the employee was fired within hours of the discovery, but the ramifications of the theft are far-reaching. The patient whose records were stolen addressed the Northern Inyo Hospital Board in open session Wednesday evening, testifying that the breach in confidentiality has shaken her faith in the local healthcare system and she may have to move out of the community.",
